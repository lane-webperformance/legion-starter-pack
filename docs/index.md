Getting Started With Legion
===========================

**Thank you for your patience while we set up new documentation. Anything you
find here may be incomplete.**

This is the homepage for the legion-starter-pack. If you just want to jump in,
clone and build this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/lane-webperformance/legion-starter-pack.git
	cd legion-starter-pack
	npm install
	node testcase.js

This will run the test case with only one concurrent user. To run with many
users (say, 50), try:

	node testcase.js -n 50

You can edit the `testcase.js` file to do anything you need. But before you do,
the legion-starter-pack also contains examples and documentation to help you
succeed.
